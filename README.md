Book Your Cardiac CT Scan: Take a Step Towards Heart Health with Crystal Radiology! (02) 8315 8292

When it comes to heart health, proactive screening and diagnostic tests are crucial. A cardiac CT scan is one of the most advanced imaging tools available to detect heart issues, particularly blockages or narrowing in the coronary arteries. At Crystal Radiology, we offer high-quality cardiac CT scans designed to give you a thorough assessment of your heart health in a comfortable and professional setting. Let’s explore what a cardiac CT scan is, how it benefits your health, and why Crystal Radiology is the ideal choice for your diagnostic needs.

What is a Cardiac CT Scan?

A cardiac CT scan, also known as coronary CT angiography (CTA), is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays and computer technology to capture detailed images of your heart and its blood vessels. This scan provides a 3D view of your heart, offering high-resolution images that allow medical professionals to see the coronary arteries and evaluate for any plaque buildup, narrowing, or blockages.

Why Book a Cardiac CT Scan?

For individuals at risk of heart disease, a cardiac CT scan is a highly valuable diagnostic tool. Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) allows you and your physician to make informed decisions about treatment, lifestyle changes, and preventative measures to protect your heart.

Here are a few reasons why you might consider scheduling a cardiac CT scan:

Assessing Coronary Artery Health: A cardiac CT scan can reveal the presence of plaque in the coronary arteries. Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, restricting blood flow to the heart and potentially leading to a heart attack if left untreated.

Evaluating Chest Pain or Other Symptoms: If you’ve been experiencing chest pain or other symptoms that could be related to heart disease, a cardiac CT scan can help your healthcare provider determine if CAD is the cause.

Identifying Heart Disease Risks Early: Heart disease often develops slowly over time. Detecting plaque buildup or artery narrowing before it becomes symptomatic gives you the opportunity to make changes and potentially prevent further progression.

Clear, Detailed Imaging: Cardiac CT scans provide high-quality images that can show soft tissues, blood vessels, and even small amounts of plaque with exceptional clarity. This precise imaging can also aid in planning treatments such as stents or bypass surgery if necessary.
